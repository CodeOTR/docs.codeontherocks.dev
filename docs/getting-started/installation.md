# Installation

### Depend on it
Run this command:

With Flutter:

```
flutter pub add code_on_the_rocks
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):

```yaml
dependencies:
  code_on_the_rocks: ^0.0.7
```

Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

### Import it
Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:code_on_the_rocks/code_on_the_rocks.dart';
```
